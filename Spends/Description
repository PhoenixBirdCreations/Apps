This app is a limited first test to publish in the Play Store. It's a simple yest intuitive and useful place to keep track of your daily 
small spends that at the end of the month look like missing money.
Until 5 different concepts can be added, and unlimited expenses entries inside. They can be eliminated and edited, and are restarted every
month.
There's a great section that allows you to check how much you spend in total each month, and compare it to a single concept at a time.
The app keep your data for a year, and when you enter again a month, the data is overwritten.
YOUR DATA IS YOURS. All the content is in your phone, nobody has access to what you write.

Currently this app in in beta testing because it should have a little ad banner at the bottom but for some reason is not showing. 
Besides of that, is absolutely functional.

You can find it at the Play Store by looking for Spends, by PhoenixBirdCreations.
It's made in Unity.
